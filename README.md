# CS170-Horse-Racing-Problem

Author: Yaoyang Zhang, Matthew Li, Lakshay Badlani

This is the final project of CS170 Algorithm class. We implemented various heuristic algorithms to tackle a NP-hard problem.

The problem statement can be found [here](https://github.com/zyy-martin/CS170-Horse-Racing-Problem/blob/master/project.pdf).

Our algorithm description can be found [here](https://github.com/zyy-martin/CS170-Horse-Racing-Problem/blob/master/AlgorithmExplained.pdf).
